# Face Recognition Trainer

This repository contains code to train a face recognition model using OpenCV's LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithm. The model is trained on images of faces organized by person in subdirectories and generates a `.yml` file with the trained model, along with the features and labels saved as `.npy` files.
